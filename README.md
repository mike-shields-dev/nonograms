# Nonograms (Logic Game)

## Intro

Nonograms is a grid based game where you have to complete the grid based on the hints given for each row and column.
Each number in the hints represents a grouping of "filled in" cells within that row or column.
Similar to Sudoku, cross-referencing the hints of the rows and columns enables the player to deduce where the filled-in cells are.
